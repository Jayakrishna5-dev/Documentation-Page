            </header>
            <p>Cinematography is the art and technique of capturing visual images for film and video production. It
                involves a combination of various elements such as lighting, composition, camera movement, color, and
                lens choices, all of which contribute to the overall storytelling and aesthetic of a project. A skilled
                cinematographer, or director of photography (DP), carefully crafts each of these components to evoke
                specific emotions, set the tone, and guide the audience’s attention throughout the narrative. This
                documentation explores the fundamental aspects of cinematography, providing an in-depth look at how
                visual techniques are used to enhance the cinematic experience.

            <p>Camera movement is a crucial aspect of cinematography that helps to convey emotion, enhance storytelling,
                and guide the audience's focus. By altering the camera’s position and movement, filmmakers can create a
                dynamic visual experience that complements the narrative. Common types of camera movements include pans,
                tilts, dollies, tracking shots, and handheld shots, each serving a distinct purpose. For example, a
                slow, deliberate tracking shot can heighten tension, while a rapid pan might evoke a sense of urgency.
                Camera movement also works in harmony with other cinematographic elements, such as lighting and
                composition, to build atmosphere and immerse viewers in the story.

                <p>Camera angles play a vital role in shaping how a scene is perceived and influencing the audience's
                    emotional connection to the story. The angle at which the camera is positioned relative to the
                    subject can convey power dynamics, emotional states, or the importance of a particular character or
                    object. Common camera angles include the eye-level shot, which presents a neutral perspective; the
                    high-angle shot, which can make a subject appear vulnerable or powerless; and the low-angle shot,
                    which can evoke a sense of dominance or grandeur. Additionally, extreme angles, such as bird's-eye
                    views or worms-eye views, can create dramatic or surreal effects. By strategically choosing camera
                    angles, filmmakers can guide the viewer’s interpretation and enhance the visual narrative.

            <div class="lighttext">
                <p>Camera lighting is a fundamental element of cinematography that shapes the mood, tone, and visual
                    appeal of a scene. It not only illuminates the subject but also creates depth, texture, and
                    atmosphere. Lighting can be manipulated in various ways to highlight or conceal details,
                    establish
                    time of day, or evoke certain emotions. Key lighting techniques include three-point lighting,
                    which
                    uses a combination of key, fill, and back lights to achieve balanced, natural illumination, and
                    high-contrast lighting, which can create dramatic shadows and emphasize mystery or tension. The
                    color temperature of the lighting—whether warm or cool—can further influence the emotional tone,
                    while practical lights (such as lamps or streetlights) can add realism. Ultimately, the creative
                    use
                    of lighting is essential in guiding the viewer's attention and enhancing the narrative's visual
                    storytelling.

                <h2>Composition</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Composition in cinematography refers to the arrangement of visual elements within the frame, guiding the
                viewer's eye and supporting the narrative. It involves decisions about framing, balance, symmetry, and
                the positioning of subjects and objects, all of which contribute to the aesthetic and emotional impact
                of a scene. </p>
            <p>Key principles of composition include the rule of thirds, which divides the frame into nine
                equal parts to create balance and focus, and leading lines, which draw the viewer’s attention to
                important elements or direct the flow of the scene. Depth and layering can also be used to create a
                sense of space and perspective, while negative space can emphasize isolation or tension. Effective
                composition helps convey meaning, evoke emotions, and enhance storytelling by visually guiding the
                audience through the narrative.</p>
